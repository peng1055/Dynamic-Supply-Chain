<h2><b>Background introduce of supply chain</b></h2><br>
Overall, the supply chain can be divided into <b>internal supply chain</b> and <b>external supply chain</b>.
<br><br>
In the process of production and circulation, the internal supply chain is a network formed by many departments of a company, including the <b>internal purchasing , production, warehousing, and sales.</b> On the other hand, the external supply chain refers to the network composed of <b>raw material vendors, facilities, Warehouses, and final consumers </b> which related to the enterprise.

In this part, we only focus on the external supply chain.
<br>

There are some important roles in a supply chian:
<br>
1. Vender <br>  
2. Facility <br>

2. Transport raw materials from venders to facilities<br>
3. Assemble products in facilities<br>
4. Transport products from facilities to warehouses<br>
